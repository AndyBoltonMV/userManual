        <ul>
          <li>
            I love sharing my knowledge, whether it's teaching or just
            conversation.
          </li>
          <li>I enjoy learning new things, in virtually any subject.</li>
          <li>
            I'm still in the honeymoon phase of coding, I still love to write
            code for fun as a hobby.
          </li>
          <li>
            I live and breathe the bootcamp model. As someone who struggled and
            failed in traditional education, the bootcamp model inspired me to
            be part of the change I needed in my own education.

        <h3 class="bold">How best to communicate with me:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I'm most efficient in Slack for communication as I can get a little
            over stimulated in video calls and end up on tangents trying to
            empty my brain.
          </li>
          <li>
            That being said, I find video calls a lot more relaxed and enjoyable
            for non-urgent comms.

        <h3 class="bold">How to help me:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I'm very independent when working through problems, so if I've asked
            for help it's due to me having spent a great deal of time trying to
            solve the problem on my own.
          </li>
          <li>All suggestions and solutions are welcome.</li>

        <h3 class="bold">What people misunderstand about me:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I struggle with Acute Obsessive Compulsive Disorder so my compulsive
            behaviours can materialise (and de-materialize, WIN ðŸ™Œ) on a whim.
            This can mean I get very adamant at sticking to a rigid structure or
            method. If I ever appear to be unwavering in a solution it's more
            than likely because of this. Having said that, on analysis I can
            alter these behaviours. I'm always more than happy to talk about my
            condition and I'll never be offended by questions asked about it.
